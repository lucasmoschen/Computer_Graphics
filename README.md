# Computer Graphics
Repository of the projects in the subject Introduction to Computer Graphics. I will use Javascrict and HTML as languages to help showing what I want. In some cases, I wil just use python.

In the first project, I use the Primary Human B Cell Dataset, in https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/tem.en.html. The images are in TIFF format, but HTML in Google Chrome Browser does not accept, so I have converted to PNG format. The pillow file does that with pillow module.
